ASLearn is a conceptual web based learning platform built to rethink how academic materials are organized and accessed in universities.

Instead of relying on scattered sources and unstructured sharing, ASLearn introduces a clear academic hierarchy where learning resources are classified by University, Major, Subject, and Lecturer. This approach allows students to reach the exact material they need with minimal effort and zero ambiguity.

The project emphasizes trust as much as accessibility. Every document is designed to be validated through a dual trust model that combines lecturer verification, student feedback, and internal review. The goal is to create a learning environment where quality is visible, not assumed.

This repository represents the frontend implementation of ASLearn. It is built with a clean, responsive design using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on clarity, usability, and scalability. The structure is intentionally simple to allow future expansion, including backend services, user authentication, and AI driven search and recommendation systems.

ASLearn is developed as both a learning project and a foundation for a larger educational platform, aiming to reduce friction in academic learning and bring structure to knowledge sharing.
