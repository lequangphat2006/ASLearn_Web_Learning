# ASLearn - Web Learning Platform

ASLearn is a modern web-based learning platform designed for university students in Vietnam. The project focuses on organizing academic materials in a clear, structured, and trustworthy way, helping students quickly find the right documents without confusion.

This repository contains the frontend implementation of ASLearn, built with clean and responsive web technologies.

## Project Overview

Finding high-quality study materials is often difficult due to scattered sources, poor organization, and lack of verification. ASLearn addresses this problem by introducing a structured learning system combined with content trust validation.

The core concept of the platform is **Super Classification**, where learning materials are organized by **University → Major → Subject → Lecturer**. With this structure, users can locate relevant materials in just three steps.

To ensure reliability, ASLearn applies a **Dual Trust** mechanism that includes lecturer verification, student evaluation, and internal review.
